        <h1 class="h-font">Mardi Gras in New Orleans</h1>
    <div class="p-div">
      <p>
        The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including
        the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated for about two
        weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday
        (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is
        one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days have several
        large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the
        last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events
        occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including
        parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).
      </p>
      <p>
        The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as
        krewes; most follow the same parade schedule and route each year. The
        earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the
        earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several
        modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and
        events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming
        celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus
        (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as the
        Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American krewe.
        Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common
        throws are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated
        plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys. Major
        krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year.
      </p>
      <p>
        While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon
        Street, major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and
        follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver
        side of the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du
        Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in the Faubourg Marigny
        and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi Gras
        day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex
        and Comus.

      <h2 class="h-font">LaToya Cantrell</h2>
      <p>
        LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American
        politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana since May 7,
        2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office. Before
        becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City
        Council from 2012–2018
      </p>
      <h3 class="h-font">Early life and education</h3>
      <p>
        Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New
        Orleans in 1990 to attend Xavier University of Louisiana, where she
        earned a BA in sociology.She attended an executive training program at
        the Harvard Kennedy School.
      </p>
      <h3 class="h-font">Broadmoor neighborhood work</h3>
      <p>
        Cantrell returned to New Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor
        neighborhood. In 2003, she joined the board of the Broadmoor Improvement
        Association and became president of the association in 2004. After the
        2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina,
        the Broadmoor neighborhood flooded severely and remained mostly deserted
        for months afterward. In early 2006, the Bring New Orleans Back
        Commission, a blue-ribbon panel convened by then-mayor Ray Nagin,
        released a recovery plan that called for Broadmoor and five other New
        Orleans neighborhoods to be converted into greenspace. In her role as
        president of the association, Cantrell worked with residents and local
        religious leaders to organize opposition to the panel's recommendation.
        She also helped enlist returning Broadmoor residents in a six-month
        effort to write a recovery plan for the neighborhood. Cantrell worked
        full time to implement Broadmoor's recovery plan from 2006 through 2012.
        She and fellow residents formed the Broadmoor School Board, overseeing
        the reopening and renovation of the Andrew H. Wilson school. She served
        as a founding board member of the Broadmoor Development Corporation, a
        community development corporation that provided case management and
        other social services for returning residents. She was involved with
        residents' efforts to reopen Broadmoor's Rosa F. Keller Library, which
        won a $2 million grant from the Carnegie Endowment. She created a
        partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and Church of
        the Annunciation, which provided the neighborhood association with
        office space and hosted volunteer groups. She also formed a partnership
        between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and her home parish,
        Blessed Trinity Catholic Church, to open the Broadmoor Art and Wellness
        Center.

      <h3 class="h-font">Political career</h3>
      <h4 class="h-font">New Orleans City Council</h4>
      <p>
        In 2012, Cantrell declared her candidacy for the New Orleans City
        Council seat vacated when former District B representative Stacy Head
        won an election to an at-large position. After the November election,
        candidate Dana Kaplan and Cantrell advanced to a December runoff, which
        Cantrell won with 54 percent of the vote.Cantrell served out the balance
        of Head's term, and was unopposed for a full four-year term in 2014. As
        a council member, Cantrell focused on health, housing, and
        criminal-justice issues. She introduced a bill banning smoking at
        restaurants and bars within New Orleans, citing the health effects of
        secondhand smoke on service industry workers.The council unanimously
        passed the bill in 2015.[16] Also in 2015, Cantrell began work to open a
        low-barrier homeless shelter, a move that was objected to by residents
        because of its proposed placement in Central City, New Orleans. Instead,
        the shelter was moved to the downtown site of the former VA Hospital. In
        2017, Cantrell introduced legislation with at-large council member Jason
        Williams to register and inspect rental units in the city. As a member
        of the Criminal Justice Committee, Cantrell has participated in efforts
        to install crime cameras in her district, assess the effectiveness of
        citywide anti-gun-violence campaigns, and address understaffing at the
        New Orleans Police Department.
      </p>
      <h4 class="h-font">2017 mayoral election</h4>
      <p>
        Cantrell declared her candidacy for mayor of New Orleans in March 2017
        in a race to replace term-limited mayor Mitch Landrieu. An open primary
        was held on October 14 and included 18 candidates. Cantrell garnered the
        most votes, winning 39% of the total.In the November 18 runoff election,
        Cantrell defeated fellow Democratic opponent Desiree Charbonnet, a
        former municipal judge, with 60% of the vote. She is the first woman to
        lead New Orleans in its 300-year history, as well as the first mayor not
        born in the city since Vic Schiro.
